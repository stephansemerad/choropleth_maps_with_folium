# pln_fx | Get Rates from the National Bank of Poland

So the ECB (European Central Bank) publishes PLN (Zloty) rates but for accounting purposes in Poland there is a requirement to use the rate directly from the Polish National Bank instead of the ECB. Therefore I wrote this library because I am sure other people will need this and I havent found any library. So I dit it.
